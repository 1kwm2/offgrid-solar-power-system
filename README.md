# offgrid-solar-power-system
This algorithm determines the probabilistic size of renewable generation and energy storage for an off-grid (stand-alone) power system. The main result of the algorithm is there are many possible configurations of renewable generation and energy storage that are inversely related. In other words, the required amount of storage for an off-grid system is inversely related to the amount of generation. This is because the minimum probabilistic generation size requires seasonal storage, storing energy in the summer to use during the winter, which involves a lot of storage. As the generation size increases the need for seasonal storage decreases.
