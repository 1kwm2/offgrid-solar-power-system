# offgrid-solar-power-system
This algorithm estimates the PV system size and energy storage capacity for a renewable, off-grid (stand-alone) power system. The main result of the algorithm is there are many possible configurations of PV and storage that are inversely related. In other words, the required amount of storage for an off-grid system is inversely related to the amount of generation. This is because the minimum probabilistic generation size requires seasonal storage, storing energy in the summer to use during the winter, which involves a lot of storage. By increasing generation the need for seasonal storage decreases.
